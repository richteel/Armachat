<p>
	The software can work on a variety of hardware. The software focuses on the differences between keyboards 
	and displays. Currently the software supports the keyboard layouts for the Max, Compact, and Watch. The 
	software supports displays using controllers ST7789 and ST7735R with sizes of 320x240, 280x240, 240x240, and 160x80 pixels.
</p>
<p>
	Testing has only been conducted on the following hardware.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Armachat Compact with 320x240 pixel screen utilizing ST7789 controller</li>
	<li>Armachat Watch with 160x80 pixel screen utilizing ST7735R controller</li>
</ul>

<p>
	These steps assume that you have already setup your Raspberry Pi Pico or RP2040 board with CircuitPython and
	have copied the Armachat software onto the board.
