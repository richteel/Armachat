- All/most of the functionality that [bobricius/Armachat-circuitpython](https://github.com/bobricius/Armachat-circuitpython) intended.
- Allow the code to work on the Max, Compact and Watch versions of the hardware
- Provide some confirmation messages
- When not connected to a PC as a device on boot, allow saving of configuration information
- Include detailed documentation for users and developers
